# Question Classification using Deep Neural Netowrk Models

# Introduction

This project attempts to solve question type classification problem using Deep Learning methods.I have implemented various
Question Classification models in Tensorflow Keras APIs 2.1.6-tf.


# Data Source

Dataset has following 6 distinct question types and 50 sub-types and it is divided into 2 files train and test.

|Primary Classes| ENTITY, NUMERIC, LOCATION, HUMAN, DESCRIPTION, ABBREVIATION|
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|

Training data set has total 5452 samples questions. Training data is divided into 4952 training samples and 500 validation samples. Test data set has total 500 sample questions.
 
TREC question type dataset is avaiable at follwing link [http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/Data/QA/QC/train_1000.label]

# How to run?
Program can run in 2 modes, Training and Testing mode and Testing mode. In training mode, it runs the traning alogrithm on seleted model or all models with give or default training data set and then test the model with given or default test data set.
